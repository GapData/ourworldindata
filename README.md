This package contains data frames which have been generated by combining datasets from [OurWorldInData.org](https://ourworldindata.org): "an online publication that shows how living conditions around the world are changing". The data frames in this package have undergone tidying so that they are suited to immediate analysis in R. The purpose of this package is to serve as a central R resource for these datasets so that they might be used for the likes of practice or exploratory data analysis in a replicable manner.

Considerable thanks must go to [Max Roser](http://www.maxroser.com/about/) and the rest of the [OurWorldInData team](https://ourworldindata.org/about/), who collate the datasets that are included in this package. If you appreciate their work and make use of this package, please consider supporting [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/support/).

Data sets included in this package:
===================================

Population
----------

-   `child_mortality`: Country-level changes in child mortality rates and related variables over time. A combination of all datasets available at <https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality>.

Health
------

-   `financing_healthcare`: Country-level changes in the financing of healthcare and related variables over time. A combination of datasets available at <https://ourworldindata.org/financing-healthcare>.

Contributing to the ourworldindata R Package
============================================

Contributing to this package necessarily involves adding a data object to be exported with the package, and documentation that explains the data and variables. Ideally, an R file that shows how the data was compiled will also be included. These additions should appear as the following:

-   `data/NAME-OF-DATA.rda` which is the data object to be exported with the package.
-   `R/NAME-OF-DATA.R` which contains the roxygen comments that describe the data and each variable, and provide a link to the data source.
-   `R/data_prep/NAME-OF-DATA_prep.R` which is an R script that demonstrates how the data was compiled. These files will be ignored in the package build.

Additionally, be sure to add the package to the lists in the README (`README.Rmd`) and package documentation (see `R/ourworldindata.R`).
