This package contains data sets extracted from [OurWorldInData.org](https://ourworldindata.org): "an online publication that shows how living conditions around the world are changing". These data sets have undergone tidying so that they are suited to immediate analysis in R. The purpose of this package is to serve as a central R resource for these data sets so that they might be used for the likes of practice or exploratory data analysis in a replicable manner.

Considerable thanks must go to [Max Roser](http://www.maxroser.com/about/) and the rest of the [OurWorldInData team](https://ourworldindata.org/about/), who collate the data sets that are included in this package. If you appreciate their work and make use of this package, please consider supporting [OurWorldInData](https://ourworldindata.org/support/).

At present, this package contains the following data sets:
